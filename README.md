# Hello World
I, Steven Short, am a student studying towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am a fairly self motivated worker striving to
break into the technology industry. Currently, I spend most of my free time studying different technologies or working on personal projects.

## Why Sparrow Detail?
Honestly I just find Sparrows interesting and decided to create a name around that to share my personal works. The full name is just a play on
words for the phrase 'spare no detail' and all-in-all can represent my drive to provide thoroughly thought-out contributions while representing
my more whimsical personality.

## My current projects ðŸ”­

### The Sparrow Detail Webpage - rework in progress
A one stop shop to see what I've been working on or to get in contact.

### [Dungeon;Bot](https://github.com/SparrowDetail/DungeonBot) (Discord Application)
This idea came about when one of my hobbies, Dungeons and Dragons (DnD), had to be pushed to an online environment as my friends and I settled into
our separate walks of life. The intention is to simplify the operation and provide useful utilities to discord servers hosting DnD sessions. The
features are somewhat lacking at the moment, but will continue to grow as new ideas flow!

## Currently Learning ðŸŒ±
- Next.js
- C++ in software development
- Advanced Python Design
